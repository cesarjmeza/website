I'm a fifth year Ph.D. student in mathematics at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://math.wustl.edu) working with [Laura Escobar](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~escobar/index.html) and [John Shareshian](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~shareshi/). My research interests include algebraic and geometric combinatorics.
